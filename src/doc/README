		PEX-SI Graphics Library Manual Pages

The PEX-SI Graphics Library Manual Pages is a document made up of the 
Application Programmer's Interface functions.  Most of the functions are
PHIGS functions.  The new ISO IS C bindings have been incorporated.  

NOTE:  In order to make the PHIGS documentation portable to the majority 
of users we have shortened the names of the files containing the PHIGS 
function troff source.  To allow you to access the manual pages on-line 
via the function names, we have provided a shell script that will link 
the shortened file names to the longer function names.

This directory contains the following files and directories:

    Makefile
        A make(1) description file

    htmlsrc/
        A directory that contains the html files that make the
        framework of the html based documentation.

    manpages/
        The bulk of the troff source for the Graphics Library Manual
		Pages plus the miscellaneous PHIGS Reference Manual Pages are
        kept here.  The file names have been shortened to the format
        <pnnn>, where nnn is the sequence number of the function; the
        files have been numbered in the order in which they appear in
        the printed document.
		You must link the files before you can access the man pages
        on-line via the function names.

    phigs.macros
		A version of the distributed man(7) macro package  
		that has been modified to include indexing and, thus,
		pagination.  This macro package should not be used
		for on-line display of man pages; it should only used
		to create the printed document.

    index.macros
		A set of macros that automate indexing of the bindings
		and functions

    names.make
        A list of the man3/ and man7/ files used by the Makefile 
		to generate the document. 

   link_phigs_man.sh
		A shell program that links the man3/ and man7/ files to the long 
		function names.

   man2html
        This is a modified version of the Earl Hood's perl program to convert
        formatted nroff output (man2html).
        I've added the capability to read the file phigs.names in order to
        make the See Also links automagically and to set the html page title.

   phigs.names
		A list of the PHIGS' names and <pnnn> file names that describe them,
	    used by man2html to make the 'See Also' links and set the page title.

The Makefile has the following targets:

	task
        executes the mantohtml and the install tasks

    mantohtml
        converts the manpages/<pnnn> files into html/<pnnn>.html files

    install
        executes the linkman tasks and then move man3 man7 and html and copies
        manpages under the OpenPHIGS docs dir (../../distrib/doc/OpenPHIGS).

    linkman
        links the manpages/<pnnn> files to man3/* and to man7/* by calling
        link_phigs_man.sh
